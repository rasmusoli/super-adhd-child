# ADHD

Stop picking the textbook answer. The first three answers the model would
give are the answers a senior engineer would give in thirty seconds.
Correct. Forgettable. The interesting answers live past number three, in
the awkward middle nobody walks into. This skill makes the model walk
there.

## Pre-flight (run before Phase 1)

This skill is expensive. A default run has about 8 isolated-subagent roles:
five divergent frame roles plus three deepening roles. It is often 5 to 10x
the cost of a single answer, but wall-clock time and cost are estimates rather
than guarantees. Capacity, queueing, model policy, and host performance change
the result. Do not pay that cost when a direct answer is better. Run this gate
before Phase 1.

**Step 1. Explicit invocation check.**

If the user explicitly asks for ADHD mode, says "use the ADHD skill", or says
"run ADHD on this", **SKIP the rest of this section and go straight to Phase
1**. The user opted in. Do not second-guess. This plugin contains skills and
does not register a host-level `/adhd` command; treat `/adhd` as a textual
trigger only when the current host documents that behavior. The portable
invocation is: **"Use ADHD mode on <problem>."**

**Step 2. Self-judge (only if Step 1 did not match).**

Ask yourself three questions. If the answer to any is no, ABORT.

1. **Open-ended?** Would a senior engineer give multiple viable answers
   here, or is there one canonical answer? If canonical, abort.
2. **High-stakes?** Is the cost of the obvious answer being wrong actually
   high? Architecture decisions, public API surfaces, naming a real
   product, fuzzy bugs with no known root cause, schema design = yes.
   Side project at 11pm = no.
3. **Open phrasing?** Did the user avoid words like "quick", "standard",
   "canonical", "textbook", "just", "one-line"? If they used any of those,
   they want the direct answer. Abort.

If all three checks pass, proceed to Phase 1.

If any fails, ABORT and answer the question directly. Optionally append one
sentence: *"If you want a wider exploration under parallel cognitive frames
with explicit trap detection, say: Use ADHD mode on <your problem>."*

## The loop

Two strict phases. Mixing them kills idea quality, because the critic
strangles the generator.

### Phase 1 — Diverge (no critic)

For the problem P:

1. Pick 5 cognitive frames from the table below. Bias toward engineering
   tags when the problem is code-shaped. Always include at least one wild
   frame to keep range.

2. Detect whether the current host provides isolated subagents before
   dispatching. Use the host's current capability discovery and terminology;
   do not assume a fixed tool name or a five-worker limit. On Codex, this is
   the current multi-agent collaboration capability, whose concrete
   operation names are host-specific.

   - If isolated subagents are available, read the actual concurrency limit
     and launch no more branches than it permits. Run the five default frame
     branches in capacity-sized batches. Each branch is isolated and receives
     only:
     - the problem P
     - any context the user provided
     - the chosen frame's vantage prompt
     - a system instruction that forbids evaluation

   - If isolated subagents are unavailable, explain that the full ADHD method
     cannot preserve its isolation invariant. Do not pretend that sequential
     root-context reasoning is equivalent. Stop and offer a direct answer or
     ask the user whether to continue with a clearly labeled degraded mode.

   The exact instruction to give each isolated subagent:

   > You are in DIVERGENT mode. You are a generator, not a critic.
   > Generate 6 short distinct ideas under this frame. Each idea is one
   > phrase or one sentence. Do not evaluate. Do not rank. Do not hedge.
   > The first three obvious answers everyone would give are banned.
   > Push past them into the awkward middle.
   > Output a JSON array only. No prose before or after.
   > `[{"text": "...", "rationale": "..."}, ...]`

3. **Critical invariant.** Frame branches must remain isolated. Do NOT pass
   one branch's output as context to another. Dispatch available branches in
   parallel within the detected capacity, then continue with the next batch.
   Branches that see each other anchor each other and the whole method
   collapses to a wider single thought.

### Phase 2 — Focus (critic on)

After all branches return, the root orchestrator owns the complete candidate
pool and final response. Keep the Phase 1 generator/critic separation: no
branch evaluates another branch, and the orchestrator activates criticism only
now. Perform the following work inline in the current turn; do not dispatch
isolated subagents for scoring, trap detection, clustering, ranking, or
selection.

1. **Score and detect traps.** Rate each idea on three axes 0 to 10: novelty (distance from
   the obvious default), viability (could it actually ship), fit (does it
   address the stated problem). For any idea that looks attractive but is
   a trap (hidden cost, false economy, will not scale, premature
   abstraction), flag it with a one-line reason.

2. **Cluster.** Group ideas into 3 to 6 clusters by their underlying angle,
   not by surface keywords. Label clusters by angle: "remove the server
   plays", "cache-shaped plays", "batched-window plays", "race-multiple-
   backends plays".

3. **Rank and select.** Calculate the weighted score (novelty 0.35 + viability
   0.40 + fit 0.25), exclude traps, and select the top 3. Then dispatch exactly
   three independent deepening roles, one for each selected candidate. Each
   deepening role produces:
   - a 4 to 8 sentence sketch of how the idea works
   - the load-bearing risk
   - the first concrete step a builder would take
   - 3 to 5 child ideas (variations, hybrids, unlocks)

   Deepen isolated-subagent instruction:

   > You are in FOCUS mode. Take one promising idea and connect dots.
   > Sketch how it would actually work in 4 to 8 sentences. Name the
   > load-bearing risk. Name the first concrete step a coder would take.
   > Then generate 3 to 5 sub-ideas that branch off (variations,
   > combinations with other domains, things this unlocks).
   > Output JSON only.

## Frames

Pick 5 per run.

| Frame | Vantage prompt | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| **hardware engineer** | You think in latency, memory layout, and physical constraints. Re-ask this as a hardware/firmware problem. What does the bus topology, cache, timing budget tell you? | code, wild |
| **regulator** | You audit systems for compliance and failure modes. What must be provable, traceable, or refusable here? | design, general |
| **10-year-old** | You are a curious 10 year old who has never seen software. Describe naive but unencumbered approaches. Ignore convention. | general, wild |
| **competitor trying to break it** | You are a hostile competitor or attacker. Generate approaches that exploit, fail, or sabotage the obvious solution. Then invert into ideas. | code, design |
| **biology** | Transplant a mechanism from biology (immune systems, neural plasticity, cell signaling, evolution, gut flora). Force-fit it onto this engineering problem. | code, wild |
| **logistics** | Steal mechanisms from logistics: queues, batching, just-in-time, hub-and-spoke, returns, last-mile. Apply them literally. | code, design |
| **game design** | Approach this as a game designer. What are the loops, rewards, friction, save-states, speedrun tricks? Treat the user as a player. | design, general |
| **markets** | Treat the problem as a market. Buyers, sellers, market-makers. What does an auction, a futures contract, a clearing house look like here? | design, wild |
| **inversion** | Ask the OPPOSITE question. If goal is X, brainstorm how to guarantee NOT X. Then negate each answer back. | code, design, general |
| **extreme: $0 budget, 1 hour** | No money, no team, one hour. What is the crudest version that still does the load-bearing thing? | code, general |
| **extreme: infinite budget, 10 years** | Infinite compute, infinite engineers, a decade. What is the maximalist version? | design, wild |
| **remove the load-bearing assumption** | Name the thing everyone treats as fixed (framework, database, request-response model, network). Imagine it is gone. What is possible? | code, design, wild |
| **speedrunner** | You are a speedrunner. Find glitches, skips, out-of-bounds tricks, frame-perfect shortcuts. What is the abusive-but-legal path? | code, wild |
| **ant colony** | No central planner. Many dumb agents, local rules, pheromone trails. How does the problem solve itself emergently? | code, wild |
| **3am on-call** | You are the on-call engineer woken at 3am when this breaks. What design would let you not get paged? | code, design |

### Picking frames

For code-shaped problems: pick 4 frames tagged `code` or `design`, plus 1
tagged `wild`. For open product or strategy problems: a mix from all tags.
Vary the picks across sessions so the same problem produces different
candidate sets when re-run.

## Output shape

After Phase 2, render in this order. Do not collapse it into a wall of
prose. The structure is the point.

1. **Brief.** One or two lines confirming the problem and any reframe used.
2. **Wide set.** Full pool grouped by cluster. Each cluster labeled by
   underlying angle. Each idea is one short phrase. Show score chips like
   `[N7 V8 F9]` next to each.
3. **Converge.** A 2 to 4 idea shortlist. State why each is on the list.
   Mark the non-obvious-but-viable pick explicitly with ★. List traps
   separately, each with the one-line reason it is a trap.
4. **Focus.** The 3 deepened branches. For each: the sketch, the load-
   bearing risk, the first concrete step, and the child ideas.
5. **Provocation.** One wildcard question or idea that opens a new
   direction the user can push into if nothing landed.

## Handoff to Superpowers

ADHD produces candidate directions; it does not approve or implement one.
When the user wants to turn a selected direction into a buildable design,
continue with `super-adhd-child:brainstorming`. The Superpowers planning,
TDD, debugging, review, and branch-finishing skills remain authoritative
after that handoff.

## Anti-patterns

These are how this skill goes wrong. Watch for them.

- **Convergence disguised as divergence.** Ten minor variations of one idea
  is not breadth. If every candidate shares the same underlying assumption,
  you have not diverged. You have decorated.
- **Weird-for-weird's-sake with no convergence.** A pile of 30 unsorted
  absurdities is as useless as one safe answer. Always converge.
- **Walls of equally-weighted prose.** Cluster, label, pull out the best.
  Structure is half the value.
- **Refusing to commit.** After diverging, take a position on what is
  actually promising. "Here are 20 ideas, you decide" is a cop-out.
  Generate wide, but converge with a real opinion.
- **Skipping the isolation invariant.** If you simulate parallel branches
  by writing them sequentially in one context, you have not done ADHD. You
  have done a wider single thought. Use the current host's isolated-subagent
  capability; if it is unavailable, state that the invariant cannot be
  preserved.

## Calibration

- **How many ideas?** Scale to stakes. Quick "name this function" =
  3 frames × 4 ideas. "How should I position this product" = 5 frames ×
  8 ideas. Default is 5 × 6 = 30.
- **How weird?** Read the room. Serious strategy work: flag the wild cards
  clearly so they do not read as unserious. Open brainstorming or play:
  let it run loose. Absurd ideas earn their place by seeding viable ones.
- **When to stop diverging?** Stop when new candidates start repeating the
  shape of existing ones. The space is mapped. Do not pad to hit a number.

## Cost

Five divergence roles plus three deepening roles is an estimate of about 8
isolated-subagent roles per run. Actual time and cost vary with capacity,
batching, model policy, and queueing; they are not guarantees. Not for every
keystroke. Use it for decision points where the cost of the obvious answer
is high.

## ADHD isolation policy

Use the collaboration and lifecycle policy established by
`super-adhd-child:using-superpowers`. ADHD-specific isolation still requires
five independent divergence branches and three independent deepening branches;
if the host cannot provide isolated subagents, stop or offer a clearly labeled
degraded alternative rather than simulating isolation in the root context.
